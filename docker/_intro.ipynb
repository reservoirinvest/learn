    "# Introduction\r\n",
    "## What is docker?\r\n",
    "A platform for building, running an shipping applications in a consistent manner.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Apps works in my machine but does not in other because:\r\n",
    "1. One or more files are missing\r\n",
    "2. Software version mismatch (node v14 v/s node v9)\r\n",
    "3. Different configuration variables. Environment variables are different across machines\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Advantages of docker\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Docker has isolated environments called *containers*\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Two machines can run side-by-side without affecting each other and in different versions   \r\n",
    "* Easy to bring someone up to speed with by downloading with <code> $docker-compose up </code>   \r\n",
    "* After we are done, we can destroy all the things in the machine and its dependancies with <code> $ docker-compose down -rmi all</code>\r\n",
    "* Prevents cluttering of development machines with library dependancies and tools from different apps\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Container\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A *container* is an isolated environment for running an application\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It is different from a *virtual machine (VM)*, because a VM is an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware).\r\n",
    "* We can run several virtual machines in a real physical machine - using a hypervisor (e.g. VirtualBox and VMware and Hyper-v (Windows only))\r\n",
    "* We can run two different VM with two apps with different versions in the same machine\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Problems of VM:\r\n",
    "* Each VM needs a full copy of OS. \r\n",
    "* They are slow to start (like starting a computer). \r\n",
    "* They are resource intensive (CPU, mem and diskspace)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Containers:\r\n",
    "* Give same kind of isolation\r\n",
    "* Are lightweight.\r\n",
    "* All containers OS of the host (single OS)\r\n",
    "* Container starts up quickly (within a second!)\r\n",
    "* Needs less hardware resources (100s of containers side-by-side in a single host)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Docker Architecture\r\n",
    "Docker uses client-server architecture using RESTfull API between the two. The server is called the *Docker Engine*.   \r\n",
    "Technically docker engine is just a *process* - like other process running the machine   \r\n",
    "All the container shares the *kernel* of the source. Kernel is like the engine that managers all applications and hardware resources.   \r\n",
    "Each kernel has its own API. That is why we cannot run Windows application on Linux.   \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On a linux machine, we can only run linux containers, as they need linux.   \r\n",
    "On Windows machine, however, we can run both Windows and Linux as Windows 10 ships with a custom-built linux kernel.         \r\n",
    "Mac does not support containerization. Hence Docker on Mac uses a light Linux VM.     \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Installing Docker\r\n",
    "* Upgrade to the latest version from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/)\r\n",
    "* Start the docker engine! It should show the whale.\r\n",
    "Let us now check the docker version (Server Version: 20.10.6 is loaded)"

    "# Development workflow\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Take an application and dockerize it, by adding a * Dockerfile*.    \r\n",
    "Dockerfile is a plain text file which docker uses to package files to an image that contains everything the application needs to run, typically:\r\n",
    "* Cut-down OS\r\n",
    "* A runtime environment (eg. Node)\r\n",
    "* Application files\r\n",
    "* Third-party libraries\r\n",
    "* Environment variables\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once we have an *image* we ask the docker to build a *container* based on an image.   \r\n",
    "Container is just a process, which has its own file system provided by the image.    \r\n",
    "Application gets loaded inside a container or a process.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So instead of running it locally using `my-app.py`, we ask docker to run it using `docker run ...` on the development machine.   \r\n",
    "Once we have an image we can push it to a docker *registry* like docker hub.   \r\n",
    "Docker hub is like github. Which is a storage for docker images that anyone can use.   \r\n",
    "Once image is on docker hub, we can push it to any machine running docker. This machine would contain the same image as our development machine which contains the specific version of our application with its dependancies.    \r\n",
    "With docker we no longer have to maintain non-complex release documents that have to be precisely followed.     \r\n",
    "All the instructions for building an image for an application are written in a `Docker` file. We can package our application into an image and run it on any machine.    \r\n",
