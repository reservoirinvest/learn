    "* Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approach.\n",
    "* One popular method is by creating objects. This is called OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "   * attributes\n",
    "   * behaviour\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Parrot is an object\n",
    "   * name, age, colour are its attributes\n",
    "   * singing, dancing are behaviour\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. Concept called DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:\n",
    "   * Inheritance: A process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class\n",
    "   * Encapsulation: Hiding the private details of a class from other objects\n",
    "   * Polymorphism: A concept of using common operation in different ways for differnt data input\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class\n",
    "* A *Class* is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "   * Sketch of a parrot with labels. The labels contains all details about the parrot's name, colours, size, etc.\n",

    "# Exercise and notes on classes in python\n",
    "* Class provides means of bundling data and functionality together\n",
    "* New Class is a new object, allowing instances to be made\n",
    "* Each class can have attributes attached to it to maintain its state\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objects and Names\n",
    "* Objects have individuality\n",
    "* Multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object (...also called aliasing)\n",
    "* Aliases behave like pointers and effect mutable objects (such as lists and dictionaries)\n",
    "* Passing an object in python is cheap - as only a pointer is passed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scopes and Namespaces\n",
    "* Namespace is a mapping from names to objects\n",
    "* Most namespaces in Python are implemented as dictionaries\n",
    "   * e.g. of namespace are built-in names (containing functions like abs(), and built-in exception names\n",
    "* _Note_: There is no relationship between names in different namespaces\n",
    "   * e.g. _maximize_ can define differnt functions in different modules.\n",
    "* Users mus prefix module name\n",
    "* Attributes are represented by dot (.)\n",
    "   * e.g. z.real (real is an atrribute of object z). modname.funcname (modname is a module object, funcname is an attribute to it)\n",
    "* Attributes may be read-only or writable\n",
    "   * e.g. modname.the_answer = 42\n",
    "* Attributes can be deleted with del\n",
    "   * e.g. *del modname.the_answer* will remove the attribute *the_answer*\n",
    "* Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes\n",
    "* Namespace containing built-in names are created when the Python interpreter starts up and is never deleted\n",
    "* Global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in, and lasts till interpreter quits\n",
    "* Statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or considered part of a module called __ __main__ __, so that hey have their own namespace\n",
    "* built-in names also live in a module called *builtins*\n",
    "* local namespace for function is created when the function is called and deleted (forgotten), when the function returs or raises an exception\n",
    "* A *scope* is a textual region of Python program where a namespace is 'directly accessible'.\n",
    "* Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically\n",
    "* At any time during execution there are atleast three nested *scopes* whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n",
    "   * the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names\n",
    "   * the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-loca, but also non-global names\n",
    "   * the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\n",
    "* If a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the module's global names\n",
    "* To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the *nonlocal* statement can be used\n",
    "   * If not declared *nonlocal*, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a *new* local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically outer variable unchanged)\n",
    "* The local scope references the local names of the current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module's namespace.\n",
    "* Class definitions place yet another namespace in the local scope\n",
    "* Scopes are determined textually. The global scope of a function defined in a module is that module's namespace, no matter where or by what alias the function is called.\n",
    "* However, actual search names is done dynamically at run time. So dynamic name resolution should not be relied on\n",
    "* If no global statement is in effect, the assignment to names always go to the innermost scope.\n",
    "* Assignments do not copy data, they just bind names to objects.\n",
    "* The same is true for deletion. The statement *del x* removes binding of *x* from the namespace referenced by he local scope. \n",
    "* All operations that introduce new names use local scope. \n",
    "   * In particular, *import* statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.\n",
    "* The *global* statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there\n",
    "* The *nonlocal* statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.\n",

    "* When class definition is entered, a new namespace is created and used in local scope. \n",
    "   * So, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace.\n",
    "   * In particular, function definitinos binding the name of the new function are here.\n",
    "* When class definition is left normally (via the end), a *class object* is created.\n",
